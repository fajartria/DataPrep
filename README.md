# Data Prep for Base Table

In this case, we're going to create a base table. This base table could then be used to create a Machine Learning Model and analysed to gain insight.

We will gather the available data and combine them into a single table, the granularity of this table is a client who is an account owner. A Machine learning model will not be developed since the scope of the work only covers data preparation and creation of the base table
